## 1. Project Overview

This is a simple restaurant landing page.

## 2. Key Architectural Choices

### Redux Toolkit & Redux Persist:

The app's state management is handled with Redux Toolkit, simplifying the logic for actions and reducers. This makes it easier to manage the appâ€™s global state, especially for the cart functionality. Redux Persist ensures that cart data is saved to local storage, so users can retain their cart items even after refreshing or closing the browser.

### Swiper Js:

For the carousel, Swiper.js has been used.

### React Hook Form:

For form controls, React Hook Form has been used.

### Tailwind CSS:

For styling, Tailwind CSS is used to create a responsive and modern interface. Its utility-first approach allows for rapid UI development without writing a lot of custom CSS, promoting consistency and reusability across components.

### React Icons:

React Icons enhances the visual appearance of buttons and interactive elements with vector icons, providing a cleaner look.
